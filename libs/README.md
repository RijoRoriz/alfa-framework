# ALFA-Libraries

This directory provides ready-to-use ALFA libraries. They can be used to inside your extensions to reduce the engineering effort of producing ALFA extensions.

## Available libraries

- **Metrics** [[Software]](https://github.com/alfa-project/alfa-framework/tree/main/libs/sw/alib_metrics) - This library helps developers to calculate the performance metrics of segmentation extensions. It is based on the [SemanticKITTI](http://semantic-kitti.org/) dataset. The metrics are calculated based on the confusion matrix, which is generated by comparing the ground truth labels with the predicted labels. The metrics are: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, IoU, and mIoU.
- **RAM instantiation** [[Hardware]](https://github.com/alfa-project/alfa-framework/tree/main/libs/hw/alib_ram) - This library helps developers to instantiate Block RAM and Ultra RAM memories in their hardware extensions.
- **Circular FIFO** [[Hardware]](https://github.com/alfa-project/alfa-framework/tree/main/libs/hw/alib_ram) - This library offers a circular FIFO instantiation.
